readme for modified themes and panel configuration.


1.  replace /usr/share/themes/greybird-thick-grip , greybird-thin-grip, bluebird-thick-grip, bluebird-thin-grip with the whisker_mod versions (tar.gz files provided)
2.  replace contents of /etc/skel/.config/xfce4/panel with panel foler from the xfce4-panel-with-whisker-icon-38px-width folder
3.  replace /etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce4-panel.xml with file from the xfce4-panel-with-whisker-icon-38px-width folder
4.  put mxfcelogo-rounded.png from the xfce4-panel-with-whisker-icon-38px-width folder in /usr/local/share/icons
5.  see folder clock12or24_rev8 for an additional README.txt re: installation of that script
6.  make a new user to see changes (because of way xfce4-session saves the panel config, this is the easiest way to see the changes).
